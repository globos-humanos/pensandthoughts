    <h1>The Meaning of Silence</h1>

    <p>Silence is often misunderstood as emptiness or lack of expression. In truth, silence has its own language — one that can be deeper than words.</p>

    <p>Across cultures, silence is treated with reverence: as a sign of respect, as a form of meditation, or as a way to listen beyond the noise of daily life. It is in silence that reflection and understanding take root.</p>

    <p>In our hyperconnected world, silence becomes rare. Yet, by embracing it intentionally, we rediscover presence — the art of simply being without the need to constantly speak or react.</p>

    <p>Silence, then, is not an absence. It is a presence, filled with potential meaning.</p>
